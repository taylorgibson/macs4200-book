    "# Mathematical Operations\n",
    "\n",
    "Performing mathematical operations is somewhat intuitive in the Python programming languages. The code you'll write will mostly look like how you would write the operations on a piece of paper or in a graphing calculator. Try typing some of the operations below into a Code cell in your own Jupyter Notebook, and running the cell. \n",
    "\n",
    "By default, a Jupyter Notebook will display whatever the last result of code cell directly underneath it. If a cell has multiple calculations, it will only show the last unless you specifically ask it to show the others using the `print()` function. You'll also notice that spacing between the numbers and the operators is not important. The numbers can be directly up against the operator symbols or separated with a space or two. It's good practice to find a style that works for you and be consistent."
