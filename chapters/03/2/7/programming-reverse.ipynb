    "Before writing any code, you should revisit the operations you perform by hand and write out the steps you wish to have the computer do for you. While this step may seem tedious or time consuming, it will help you form a strategy to writing your code and identify any operations you don't yet know how to do with computer code.\n",

    "## Limitations of this Code\n",
    "\n",
    "You may notice that this program is not very flexible and was pretty repetitive to write. Try using this code with a different length message and see what happens. Unless you change the code by adding new lines, or deleting existing lines, it will create an error. That's because this program coded to only successfully run with a plaintext string of length `8`. You can see that in the code, since it only makes references to indices `0` through `7`. You could alter your code for each new string you wish to encode, but it would likely be beneficial to learn other strategies to make our code flexible enough so that it works for strings of various lengths, not only one specific length."
