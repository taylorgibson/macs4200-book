    "A `while` loop implements the repeated execution of code based on a statement that resolves to be either `True` or `False`. The code that is in a `while` block will execute as long as the `while` statement evaluates to `True`. When you enter into a `while` loop, it may not be obvious how long the loop will run, and in fact, the loops could run forever! A `while` loop whose statement will never resolve to `False` is called an *infinite loop* as it will continue to run forever.\n",

The line(s) of code to be run when the statement is `True` is indented under the `while` statement. You can use two spaces or a tab to indent your code. Python is very picky about spacing, so you __must__ indent code when writing loop statements and you __must__ do so consistently (no mixing spaces and tabs)."

    "In the first example of a `while` loop, the `while` statement was checking to see if `counter` was larger than `len(message)`. Here's an example of what's called a Sentinel loop. This type of loop is looking for a variable to take on a specific value, and will continue to run the indented code until that value is reached. Typically, this type of loop is used when looking for a particular value or keypress to be inputted. For example, a correct password or a command to quit.\n",

    "As you can see, there are a lot of ways you can use a `while` loop. The flexibility does come at a price. It's very easy to unintentionally create a `while` loop that never terminates, either through improperly written code or an unexpected starting condition such that the `while` statement never returns `False`. The next type of loop, the `for` loop, is less flexible but has the benefit that it will always terminate."
