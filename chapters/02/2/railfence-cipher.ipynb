    "One common transposition method is known as the rail fence method. In this method, the message is written with alternate letters being placed into separate upper and lower lines. The half of the message written on the lower line is appended to the first half found on the upper line. This is called a 2-row railfence method since the plaintext message is divided into 2 rows.\n",

    "Since the key is the number of rows used, that sets a limit on the number of possible keys. Take our example message of 36 characters. Since you can't have a key value of 0, there's a theoretical limit of 36 possible keys, some more useful than others. Below you'll find all possible encryptions that use keys from 1 to 36. Are there any values that don't seem like very good choices?"
