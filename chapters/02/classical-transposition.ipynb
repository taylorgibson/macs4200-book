    "Let's take a look at a few transposition ciphers that are easy to perform by hand. While a few of these may seem trivial to do by hand, they are included so that later on when we start to use Python to implement these methods we have a few straight forward ciphers to ease you into it.\n",

    "* How many possible keys are there for each method?\n",
