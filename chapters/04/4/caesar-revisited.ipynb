    "# Relating Modular Arithmetic to the Caesar Cipher\n",

    "Returning to our task of enciphering the letter `x` with a key of $5$, we now know that $23 + 5 \\equiv 2 \\pmod{26}$. It's worth mentioning that $23 + 5 \\equiv 54 \\pmod{26}$ and infinitely more values besides $54$, however, there will only ever be one value that falls between $0$ and $n-1$, or in this case, $25$. This is the range of values that correspond to letters in the English alphabet. This fact ensures that we will have a unique encryption and decryption process. Notice that $28 \\equiv x \\pmod{26}$ has infintely many solutions for $x$, but $28 \\text{ MOD } 26 = x$ has only one.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, how do we find this unique number between $0$ and $25$ that is congruent to the new position value computed? Put another way, how do we reduce the newly computed position value modulo $26$? Doing so by hand isn't difficult, but it may be a bit tedious. \n",
    "* If your computed value is greater than $25$, repeatedly subtract $26$ from the value until it falls between $0$ and $25$. \n",
    "* If your computed value is less than $0$, repeatedly add $26$ until it falls between $0$ and $25$. \n",
    "\n",
    "Performing this algorithm is equivalent to determining $m \\text{ MOD } 26 = ?$, where $m$ represents the numerical value of the current letter in the message being enciphered. We'll see a bit later that most computer programming languages have a built in operation that performs the $\\text{MOD}$ calculation for you, making this process very quick."

    "We could update the encipher algorithm for the Caesar Cipher as follows:\n",
    "1. Convert plaintext letter to a numerical value, $P$\n",
    "2. Add the key value, $k$, to the plaintext value.\n",
    "3. Determine $\\left(P + k\\right) \\text{ MOD } 26$.\n",

    "\n",
    "Notice that Step 3 is valid even if $P + k$ does not exceed $25$. As such, we've reduced the complexity of our algorithm. The same 5 steps will be performed each time without making a choice that is conditional on the value of $P + k$.\n",
