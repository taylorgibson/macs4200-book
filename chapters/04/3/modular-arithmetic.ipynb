    "# Modular Arithmetic\n",
    "\n",
    "As we noticed in our work with the Caesar Cipher, for each key value there is at least one letter that results in a computed position value that doesn't fall between 0 and 25. We solved the problem by wrapping the alphabet around back to the letter `A`. This wrapping around concept is the same way we add when we're talking about time on a clock. If it were 9:00am and someone asked what the time would be in 6 hours, you would answer 3 o'clock, not 15 o'clock. 3 hours before 1 o'clock would be 10 o'clock, not -2 o'clock. Likewise, if someone asked what ciphertext letter would be obtained by enciphering the plaintext letter `x` with a key of 5, you would respond `C` by moving 5 letters to the right down the alphabet, wrapping around once you get to `Z`.\n",
    "\n",
    "You've probably already realised the couting places along the alphabet is time-consuming and annoying. Much like with telling time, there's a way to compute values that doesn't involve counting. In the case of the clock, $9 + 6 = 15$, which is 3 more than 12 (the number of positions on a clock). We write this fact as $15  \\equiv 3 \\pmod{12}$ which is read as \"15 is equivalent (or congruent) to 3 modulo 12\". Similarly, the letter `x` is encrypted as $ 23 + 5 = 28$, which is 2 more than 26 (the total number of letters in our alphabet). As such, we can write $28 \\equiv 2 \\pmod{26}$. Now we get the same answer numerically as we would get from counting, 2, which corresponds to the letter `C`. For large values, we may need to wrap around more than once. For example, what time is it 25 hours after 5 o'clock? $5 + 25 = 30$, which is 6 hours past two complete turns around the clock. It would be 6 o'clock, also denoted as $30 \\equiv 6 \\pmod{12}$\n",
    "\n",
    "These types of operations will be extremely important in your work in this course. We call this method of addition __modulo arithmetic__. On a clock the __modulus__ is 12, while in the Casear Cipher the __modulus__ is 26. Let's define this operation and set some terminology.\n",
    "\n",
    "> __Modulo Arithmetic:__ For a positive integer $n$, two numbers $a$ and $b$ are said to be congruent modulo $n$, if their difference $a − b$ is an integer multiple of $n$. That is, if there exists an integer $k$ such that $a − b = kn$. We write this as $a \\equiv b \\pmod{n}$. Put another way, $a$ and $b$ are congruent modulo $n$ if there is an integer $k$ (which could be positive, negative, or zero) such that $a = b + kn$. We call $b$ the __reduction__ of $a$ modulo $n$ or say that $a$ __reduces__ to $b$. We will use the notation MOD to indicate the reduction (for example: $28 \\text{ MOD } 26 = 2$)"
