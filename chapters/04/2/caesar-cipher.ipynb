    "# Caesar Cipher\n",
    "One way to avoid having to memorize the order of $26$ letters is to use a mathematical function to help determine the mapping based on a simpler key value. The Caesar Shift is a well known cipher that can be classified as an *additive cipher*. It earns this classification because the method requires that you convert each plaintext letter into an integer based on its position in the alphabet, then the the key value is added to the position value to determine the corresponding letter in the ciphertext. In this course, the first letter in the plaintext alphabet will be represented with the number 0, since many programming languages (Python included) starts counting with the number 0. Using a key value of 3 would yield the following mappings for sample letters `a` and `j`:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$a \\rightarrow 0 \\xrightarrow{+3} 3 \\rightarrow D \\text{ and } j \\rightarrow 9 \\xrightarrow{+3} 12 \\rightarrow M$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Completing this for each letter in the plaintext alphabet results in the following correspondance:\n",
    "```\n",
    "        0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25\n",
    "plain   a  b  c  d  e  f  g  h  i  j  k  l  m  n  o  p  q  r  s  t  u  v  w  x  y  z\n",
    "cipher  D  E  F  G  H  I  J  K  L  M  N  O  P  Q  R  S  T  U  V  W  X  Y  Z  A  B  C\n",
    "```\n",
    "Since writing the ciphertext alphabet under the plaintext alphabet has the visual appearance of rotating the top row a few spaces, this type of cipher is also known as a rotation cipher, or ROT-cipher. Using a key of $3$ is known as ROT-3.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since you can only rotate the ciphertext so many spots before you start to get repeated mappings, there are far fewer keys in the Caesar Shift system. If you count a key of $0$ as valid (although not very practical) there are only $26$ keys in this system. We have a reduction in security when compared to a general substitution cipher, but a much greater ease of use since you only need to remember one number for the key instead of the complete mapping. This give and take of security and ease of use will be a common theme throughout the course.\n",

    "Let's get into the details on how this cipher works, and attempt to find a mathematical representation of this cipher."

Additionally, a choice needs to be made in this algorithm: perform Step 3 *or* Step 4 depending on the value of $P + k$. In general, if we want a computer to eventually carry out these tasks for us, we prefer to use algorithms that are simple and straight-forward and can be executed the same way each time, as these types of algorithms are easier to program and typically more efficent to execute."
