    "# Steganography\n",
    "**_Steganography_** is the practice of hiding a message so it is unnoticeable to a potential eavesdropper. Some common practices used over the years have included: \n",
    "* hiding a message behind the wax portion of a writing tablet (Ancient Greece)\n",
    "* writing your message behind a postage stamp before mailing\n",
    "* using invisible inks. \n",
    "\n",
    "The benefit of steganography is that an enemy eavesdropper does not know that a message is being sent, and therefore can not intercept and read it. This course focuses on cryptography and cryptanalysis, not steganography."
