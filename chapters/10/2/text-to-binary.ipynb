    "## ASCII\n",
    "The American Standard Code for Information Interchange (ASCII) was one of the first widely used standards for representing text in computers as binary numbers, dating back to the 1960s. The 7-bit binary codes allow for 128 different characters which were originally used for controlling printers via telegraph. As a result, The first 32 characters (0-31 in decimal) are not printable characters, but rather what are known as __control characters__ that determined how printer should operate. For example, character 10 represents the \"line feed\" function which causes a printer to advance its paper, character 11 represents \"horizontal tab\", and character 8 represents \"backspace\".\n",
    "\n",
    "An old ASCII, or USASCII as it was sometimes called, code chart is found below.\n",
    "\n",
    "![ASCII Chart](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/cf/USASCII_code_chart.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The column would determine the left-most 3 digits of the character, while the row would determine the right-most 4 digits of the character. For example, `A` would be `1000001` and `t` would be `1110100`."

    "## Unicode\n",
    "As computers evolved and eventually overtook the telegraph for everyday communications, 8-bit representations became preferred. 8-bit numbers worked well with the newer 8, 16, 32, and now 64 bit processors found in computers. The 1 additional bit of data allowed for 128 additional character choices. As a result, ASCII evolved into many different variations that retained the original 128 characters, with very different options for the new 128 characters. Some variations were regional ( ISCII in India), VISCII in Vietnam ), others were for creating new characters that could be used to draw computer graphics. It wasn't until the early 1990s that an 8-bit standard was widely adopted, Universal Coded Character Set (__Unicode__) Transformation Format, also known as __UTF-8__. As of September 2019, solely UTF-8 characters are used on 94.0% of all web pages in the world.\n",
    "\n",
    "One benefit of UTF-8 is that you can use multiple 8-bit codes together to generate even more characters. In fact, emojis can be represented with Unicode characters. The *Smiling Face with Sunglasses Emoji* ðŸ˜Ž is represented as `11110000 10011111 10011000 10001110`.\n",
    "\n",
    "While incredibly powerful and customizable, Unicode is more complicated than we need to illustrate how binary operations can encrypt text based messages."

    "## Base64\n",
    "While ASCII and Unicode are impressive for the amount of different characters they can represent with 8-bits, in this course we'll focus on using smaller, 6-bit numbers to keep examples easier to understand. Fortunately, there's a standard for what might be considered the essential printable characters. It consists of the 26 uppercase letters, the 26 lowercase letters, the 10 numerals, and the `+` and `/` symbols. This set of 64 characters is known as __Base64__ and is widely used when sending and receiving information over the internet. Base64's primary use is to convert binary information into text so it can be sent through many established text-based communications channels such email and HTML. When received, the text is turned back into binary where it might represent an image file, audio file, or any other file that can be read by a computer. \n",
