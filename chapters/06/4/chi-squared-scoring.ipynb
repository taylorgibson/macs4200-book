    "# Chi-Squared ($\\chi^2$) Scoring\n",
    "\n",
    "As we've seen previously, frequency analysis can be helpful with some ciphers, especially the Caesar cipher. However, trying to arrange characters in frequency order to make a correspondence between plaintext and ciphertext letters is not easy, and we're no closer to finding a method better that's than brute force and visual inspection to crack the Affine and Keyword ciphers. \n",
    "\n",
    "The barchart was helpful when cracking Caesar cipher messages because it allowed us to quickly observe that the ciphertext was in fact enciphered using Caesar, since we could see the `A`/`E`, `H`/`I`, etc., spikes, and quickly determine what the best possible key would be based on how closely the ciphertext distribution matched the English language distribution. If the ciphertext distribution was shifted by 12, then the key was 12. We'll build on this idea, comparing the ciphertext to what we'd expect English to look like, but instead of visually inspecting the two distributions, we'll instead create a scoring method to rate each key used to decipher a ciphertext message. We can then use the score to rank the possible keys and choose the key with the best score.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Developing the Score\n",
    "\n",
    "To create a score for each possible key we'll use a common method in mathematics and statistics, summing squared errors. In statistics, we call the difference between the expected result and the actual result an __error__. Errors are positive when the actual value is larger than the predicted value, and negative when the actual value is less than the predicted value. In the case of our use, we'll be using the count of each character in the message as our value. The actual value will be how many times the character appears in our deciphered ciphertext, and the expected value would be how many times we would have expected the character to appear in the deciphered ciphertext based on known letter frequencies.\n",

    "That's still a lot to keep track of, so it may be tempting to sum all the individual error values to get a total error value. However, __the sum of the individual errors will always be 0.__ This is because if there are $994$ letters in the message, and there are 11 less `C`'s than expected, those 11 characters are going to appear as \"extra\" in the count for other letters. An error in one character will always get balanced out by errors in other letters. In the end the total positive errors will completely balance out the total negative errors. One way we can avoid this is by ensuring all errors are positive, so when they are summed the total is guaranteed to be positive. A common way to make values positive is to square them. So for `A`, the squared error would be $\\left(-63.17998\\right)^2 = 3991.7098728$.\n",

    "After all, having a squared error of 4 for the letter `A` (actual was 2 off from the expected) means very different things if you were expecting 5 `A`'s (pretty bad) or 5,000 `A`s (pretty good) in your plaintext. One way to account for this is to divide the squared error by the expected count. This will help normalize the squared error so you can compare the value between different letters even though the letters have different expected counts.

    "You just went through calculating the chi-squared score for the ciphertext. However, in practice you won't be concerned with the chi-squared score for the ciphertext, since we already know the ciphertext isn't the plaintext. Instead, you'll want to create plaintext candidates by attempting to decipher the ciphertext with all possible keys and score the candidate texts. Only one of the candidates will be the plaintext message, and that candidate will have a relatively low chi-squared score compared to the others. All others should have a relatively high chi-squared score. By scoring every possible candidate you can rank them by their corresponding chi-squared scores and select the candidate that produced the lowest score. The key (or keys) that generate the candidate with the lowest chi-squared score are *most likely* the same keys that generated the ciphertext message.\n",
