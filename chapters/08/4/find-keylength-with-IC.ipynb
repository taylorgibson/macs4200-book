    "# Determining the Key Length using Index of Coincidence\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the Kasiski examination technique works particularly well when messages contain repeating ciphertext fragments. However, if the author of a message is particularly careful they may be able to avoid these repeating fragments. At this point it would be difficult to determine the keylength manually. Fortunately, with the Index of Coincidence you can almost completely automate the process of determining the length of a keyword.\n",
    "\n",
    "While the Kasiski method elegantly uses repeated ciphertext fragments and the distance between them to logically deduce the length of the keyword used in a Vigenère cipher, this method is a brute force attack to determine key length.\n",
    "\n",
    "We know from earlier in this chapter that a monoalphabetic cipher has an index of coincidence near $0.066$ while a polyalphabetic cipher has an index of coincidence near $0.038$. We also know that if a Vigenère enciphered text is split into $n$ groups, where $n$ is the length of the keyword, that every letter in each group was enciphered with the same key letter, resulting in a monoalphabetic distribution of letters within each group.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can use Python to guess key lengths, split the text into groups based on the guesses, and check to see if the groups of letters are monoalphabetic or polyalphabetic. If the groups appear to be monoalphabetic then we'll know we've guessed the correct key length.\n",

The letters in groups 1 and 6 would have all been enciphered by the first letter in the keyword, since the keyword repeats after its first use. Groups 2 and 7 would have had their letters enciphered with the same second letter in the keyword, and so on.
