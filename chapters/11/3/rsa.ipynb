    "The RSA Algorithm was first published by Ron Rivest, Adi Shamir, and Leonard Adleman in 1977, and as such named using the first letter of each of their last names. It was one of the first public-key cryptosystems and is still used today for secure data transmission. This algorithm is relatively slow, and is therefore usually used only to transmit keys to symmetric ciphers (like AES, Blowfish, and Triple DES) which can encrypt data for secure storage much quicker than RSA could. So while RSA does not encrypt a large volume of data, it does encrypt very important data!\n",

    "## The Phi Function\n",

    "RSA key generation will use a common function in Number Theory, $\\varphi \\left( n \\right)$ which is known as Euler's Totient Function. This function outputs the number of integers between $0$ and $n$ that are relatively prime to $n$ (meaning they don't share a common divisor). For example, $\\varphi(8) = 4$ because $1$, $3$, $5$, and $7$ are all relatively prime with $8$. Likewise, $\\varphi(7) = 6$ because there are $6$ numbers between $0$ and $7$ that do not share a divisor with $7$: $1$, $2$, $3$, $4$, $5$, and $6$.\n",

    "In general, it's not possible to write an equation to directly compute $\\varphi(n)$. The code above essentially tries all numbers less than $n$ to determine if they share a factor other than $1$ with $n$. You could probably predict that this process is very inefficient, much like trying all the possible values of $d$ to see if it's a multiplicative inverse of $e$ when trying to crack KidRSA. \n",
    "\n",
    "There are a few shortcuts, however, for computing $\\varphi(n)$. For a prime number, $p$, it follows that $\\varphi(p) = p - 1$ since all numbers less than $p$ are relatively prime with $p$. Additionally, $\\varphi(n)$ is a multiplicative function, meaning that $\\varphi(a \\cdot b) = \\varphi(a) \\cdot \\varphi(b)$ as long as $a$ and $b$ are relatively prime. So, if you let $p_1, p_2, p_3, \\ldots$ be the prime factors of $n$, then $\\varphi(n) = \\varphi(p_1) \\cdot \\varphi(p_2) \\cdot \\varphi(p_3) \\ldots = \\left( p_1 - 1\\right) \\left( p_2 - 1 \\right) \\left( p_3 - 1 \\right) \\ldots$.

Modular exponentiation reduces the integer after each multiplication that results when raising a base to a power, instead of reducing after all the multiplications. This process keeps each intermediate step a smaller number that your computer can work with quickly and efficiently. Python has a built in function for modular exponentiation, `pow(x, y, [z])`. `x` is the base, `y` is the exponent and `z` is the modulus."

The CPU time spent on finding these factors by a collection of parallel computers amounted approximately to the equivalent of almost 2000 years of computing on a single-core 2.2 GHz AMD Opteron-based computer, so don't try this at home! The advances in computing has resulted in most RSA systems now using at least $2048$ bit values for $n$, which have $617$ decimal places.
