    "Much like when solving systems of linear equations, we can subtract off multiples of the bottom row from the previous row to generate additional rows in the table. We'll use this step to generate additional rows, such that the values that the multiples of $n$ and $e$ sum to decrease. The goal is to continue generating new rows until eventually the last row starts with the value of $1$. The number found in the second column, the column labeled $e$, is the multiplicative inverse of $e$ in modulus $n$.\n",

For example, even if $n \\approx 10^{200}$, it won't take more than $1329$ rows to determine the inverse, which is very reasonable for a computer to calculate quickly. We'll see how with the Python functions below.\n",
